# Innovation Lab Decision Support System (DSS)

## Overview

The **Innovation Lab DSS** is a decision-support tool designed for a **Large Supermarket Chain (LSC)**. Built with **Stella Architect**, the model simulates the lifecycle of innovation projects from proposal to completion. It supports strategic planning by forecasting financial outcomes, resource utilization, and operational impacts over a 5-year horizon, enabling effective decision-making.

## Features

- Simulates project lifecycles with financial and operational constraints.
- Integrates budgets, staffing, and seasonal effects to determine project feasibility.
- Provides profit and loss forecasts based on project completions.
- Offers a visual interface for scenario-based planning.
- Identifies bottlenecks and optimizes resource allocation.

## Technologies Used

- **Stella Architect**: For building the dynamic simulation model.
- **Dynamic Systems Modeling**: Stocks, flows, converters, and information flows.

## Assumptions

- Budgets and staffing are evenly distributed across four quarters.
- Projects progress linearly: Proposal → Approval → Execution → Completion.
- All projects have equal costs and durations.
- Seasonal factors influence the number of proposed projects.

## How It Works

The DSS relies on three main inputs:
1. **Budget Allocation**: Starting at AUD 12.5 million, growing annually by 3%.
2. **Staffing Levels**: Starting with 420 employees, growing annually by 5.5%.
3. **Proposed Projects**: Projects are proposed each quarter, constrained by available resources.

### Key Outputs:
- **Profit Analysis**: Determines financial outcomes based on revenue and costs.
- **Resource Utilization**: Ensures projects stay within staffing and budget limits.
- **Project Flow Tracking**: Monitors proposals, approvals, cancellations, and completions.

## Visualization

The model offers a user-friendly interface to:
- Visualize project flow and resource usage over time.
- Simulate different scenarios to optimize decision-making.
- Provide forecasts for the next 20 quarters.

## Conclusion

The Innovation Lab DSS is a valuable tool for managing innovation projects at LSC. Its adaptability ensures relevance as organizational and market conditions evolve, enabling better resource allocation and strategic planning.
